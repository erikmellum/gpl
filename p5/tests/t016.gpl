// If you fail this test, read your results/t016.myout file to see
// if a,b,c have approriate random values
//
// SOMETIMES STUDENTS INCLUDE A -1 OR +1 THAT MAKES THE RANGE INCORRECT
// random(10) should return numbers n such that:  0 <= n <= 9
// look at test t017 and make sure you numbers are all in the correct
// range
